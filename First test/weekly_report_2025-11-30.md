### Continuous flow chemistry for molecular synthesis
**Venue:** Nature | **Tier:** 2

> **🚀 Tech:** Continuous flow techniques
> **🔗 Relevance:** Continuous flow techniques, primarily used in organic synthesis, offer precise control over reaction parameters (e.g., residence time, temperature, mixing), enhanced safety, and scalability. These advantages are highly beneficial for inorganic nanomaterial synthesis to achieve narrow size distributions, control morphology, prevent aggregation, and manage exothermic reactions or hazardous reagents, addressing common challenges like clogging or inconsistent product quality in batch processes.
